# Steps 

rename example.config.js to config.js
 
       	mv example.config.js config.js           	
 
Modify the following values in config.js to the values for your Twilio Account

Now start your server with  `nodemon` and you will have your server running on localhost:3000
 
```
nodemon
[nodemon] 1.10.2
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching: *.*
[nodemon] starting `node app.js`
Express server running on port 3000
``` 
 
 
If you do not have nodemon installed, you could install it from npm or use "node app.js" to start the server.
